⚠️This project is "under construction" and has no working functionalities.

We will use Android Architecture components during the process. 
More information about app architecture: [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide)

We will also be using toolset provided by the Android KTX which is included in the Jetpack

#### Repository
Currently, the Repository only fetches the data form the server to provide it to the ViewModel.
The Repository will be updated to support data persistence using Room.
After updating this, the ViewModel would not need any changes regarding this.

### More comes as the project evolves.
